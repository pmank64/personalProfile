				<h5 class="card-title">Vice President of Marketing at IC Impact</h5>
				<p class="card-text">I am the Vice President of Marketing for IC Impact, a student run sustainability-based club at Ithaca College. As a club, we focus on bringing guest speakers to campus, and jumpstarting events and workshops that contribute to a more sustainable campus and community. IC Impact has started an Ithaca College chapter of Net Impact, a national organization that focuses on making a positive global impact both socially and environmentally. Marketing responsibilities include managing social media pages and marketing Sustainability Week, a week long series of sustainability workshops and events at Ithaca College. IC Impact plays a large role in organizing and marketing these events along with other key students, faculty members, and campus and community groups. In addition to marketing responsibilities, I was part of a group of IC Impact members who attended the Net Impact Conference in Phoenix Arizona in October of 2018. The conference included keynote presentations, panels, workshops, and other events with notable individuals, companies and organizations that are making a positive impact on the world. We had the opportunity to meet and network with other student leaders, as well as conference speakers.</p>
