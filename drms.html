				<h5 class="card-title">Software and Web Development Intern at Disability RMS</h5>
				<p class="card-text">Interned at Disability RMS, working on an Agile Software Development team. I attended meetings and took notes that were distributed to team members. Through attending daily stand-up and client meetings, and asking questions, I gained domain knowledge in the area of Disability Insurance. In additional, I gained exposure to Agile Software Development, and was able to work hands on with JIRA, and to talk with and observe our SCRUM Master, BAs, QAs, developers and other business and IT professionals. I also worked to redesign and develop the Disability RMS corporate website. The process started at the beginning of my internship, talking with a communications professional, managers and other parties to learn about the needs of the company, and to understand how to effectively redesign the website to match personas. After assessing the existing website and collecting data on effective design practices, I set up a development environment and built the new website in WordPress. The latter half of the process involved gathering remaining business requirements, collecting feedback for the new website, and working closely with a QA to resolve bugs that would prevent Disability RMS from pushing the website to production.</p>
